    <h3>Education</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering | NCSU 2021 (In final semester)</li>
		<li>Associate in Engineering [with honors] | WTCC 2018</li>
		<li>Associate in Science [with honors] | WTCC 2018</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I began my post-secondary education at Wake Technical Community College (WTCC) in 2016. After completing my dual associates I transferred to North Carolina State University (NCSU) in 2019. I have concentrations in microelectronics, nanotechnology, and integrated circuit design. I am in my final semester at NCSU and I hope to pursue a masters degree in electrical engineering.</p>
	<p>In Fall 2019 I joined the Wolfpack Motorsports (WMS) FSAE team in the electronics subsystem; my role at WMS is a hardware engineer. In 2021 our team's car placed 2nd overall in the Las Vegas event. I also secured for the team 2nd Place in the Siemens Digital Twin Electrical System Excellance Award; This also came with a $2000 prize for the team</p>
	<p>When I was at WTCC I decided I wanted to pursue a major in Electrical Engineering instead of Computer Science. For many years I studied computer programming and computer science theory, but after taking physics II at WTCC I realized that I loved hardware and enjoyed learning about circuit analysis. I still enjoy improving my programming knowledge through personal projects.</p>

    <p>Siemens recognized the innovative use of their software VeSys by our team.</p>
    <p>As the principal designer of the wiring harness design and the sole VeSys user of the team up to this point I created a wiring diagram that aided in planning and construction of the wiring harness for the 2021 car. A cash prize of $2000 was awarded to Wolfpack Motorsports.</p>

    <p>The steering wheel PCB provides interconnection between many modules inside the steering wheel of the Wolfpack Motorsports race car including a touch screen.</p>
    <p>The PCB is a two layer board with a design focusing on minizing assembled board height to fit inside the tight space in the steering wheel. Two of the components on the steering wheel PCB are a modified CAN to SPI shield and a raspberry pi zero w</p>
